## Introduction
This project was created for University coursework. This project entailed designing and developing a three-tier dynamic database-driven web application for animal adoptions. This could have been created using any server-side and front-end technologies, as long as you know how to use them. Various technologies were taught for the module, including: Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, PHP 8, PDO, HTML, Composer, Laravel, Blade, Eloquent. I chose to go the Laravel route with MySQL database.  

The project has been deployed to Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://mysterious-dusk-05193.herokuapp.com), using the following login details:
